# OddDataHosting

I decided to get some familiarity with Network encryption...... heh.... that was a bad idea...

This is the result... not bad actually. Works pretty much exactly as planned.

# What is it?

You can host files and run a few commands in the client into order to run remote scripts, download files, get Info from the server, or just Close your connection.

commands:
```
Fuck off, look in Info.md
```


# Holy shit why couldnt I have gotten into the Cyber Security Class?!?!

I originally tried to use RSA encryption.... turns out I could only encrypt 52 bytes at a time.
It took me 6 hours to figure that out... then another full day to implement Fernet.

This would have been easier had I know anything about internet Encryption.... Thanks to my HighSchool for not letting me into that Cyber Security Class.
